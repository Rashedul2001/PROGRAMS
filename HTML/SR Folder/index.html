        Traffic jams are very common in every country, especially in big cities. Because in big cities
        the population, as well as the number of vehicles, are very high.
        Therefore, with the increasing number of vehicles and overuse of roads,
        traffic jams are occurring alarmingly. Like other developing countries,
        traffic jams are also a major problem in Bangladesh as well. People are stuck for hours
        in a traffic jam; also the situation is getting worse day by day.

        Traffic jams take place for various reasons. Likewise, the number of vehicles
        such as buses, trucks, auto-rickshaws, rickshaws, private cars, etc. is increasing rapidly.
        As well as the number of unlicensed vehicles is also increasing at an alarming rate.
        Also, the drivers are not willing to follow the traffic rules. Their tendency to overtake also
        causes traffic jams. The main reason behind traffic jams is the poor knowledge about traffic rules
        of the drivers.
