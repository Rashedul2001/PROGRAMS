1. Use auto when the returning value may change occasionally
2. When returning by reference or returning by pointer, we must ensure that returning value exist until pogram ends
    or else that will cause undefined behavior.. 
3.@ to go to the spcific class or function
4. "This" is a pointer of a object in which it used. Use it as a pointer. Like for the object type " *this" and for pointer type " *this"
5.when passig the referenc we pass the value and as argument we write(type & value)
  we can use the name as value and pointer the parent value. 
  that's mean we can use the recieved value as a reference, like a regular value
  and also by changing value we use it as a pointer to parent value (parent value will also change)

6. Now when we return a value as a reference like ex.. type& function(){return value;}
    we can use the returned value as a reference or as a regular value
    we can store that in a reference type variable like ==> type &name= value;
    name is now a reference to value;
    also we can assing it to other variable ==> type name= value;
    name now contain the value of value;
    but cannot change the parent value;
7.use '\n' rather than endl it proven better.
