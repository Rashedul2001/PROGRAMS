Property:
    1. Maximum nodes at level " L = 2^L ". level starts from 0.

        L = 0, nodes = 1;
        L = 1, nodes = 2;
        L = 2, nodes = 4;

    2. Maximum nodes in a tree of height H is " 2^H - 1 ". Height starts from 1
        H = 1, nodes =1;
        H = 2, nodes = 3;
        H = 3, nodes = 7;

    3. For N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels are " log2(N+1) ". 


    4. A binary tree with L leaves has at least log2(L+1)+1 number of levels
